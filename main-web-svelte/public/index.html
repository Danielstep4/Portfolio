          <h3>
            Hello my name is
            <span> Daniel Stepanishin</span><br />
            I’m a <span>self taught</span> frontend developer
          </h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              My first interaction with coding was when I was 13. I had a knee
              injury and I was at home for a whole three months. When I say
              interaction, I mean copy paste some code and then be proud of
              myself that I created something from nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
              But at the age of 13 i had other plans. I was passionate about
              swimming, and as soon as I recovored from my injury I forgot all
              about coding and kept moving with my passion, to become a great
              swimmer and to beat swimmers like micheal phelps. But as you can
              see, I didn’t got there because of chronic injuries in the knee,
              but i never gave up until i had no choice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then at the age of 18 I got recruited by the army, and I became
              passtionate about something else. I wanted to be the best
              commandor, the leader of the platoon, to fix every problem I
              encountered. So to do that I worked hard, learned from the older
              and exprienced people at the company, and this time I succeded ,
              the feeling was amazing. By the end of the service, I wanted a new
              challange a new passion to follow and conquer. I knew it was
              coding.
            </p>
            <p>
              I worked a year as a lifeguard to save some money, to have free
              time to learn without any distraction.
            </p>
            <p>
              And since the corona virus hit I saw an opportunity to learn
              coding without any distraction. I fell in love immediately,
              because it’s the most powerful tool to fix problems not just for
              myself, but for other people too. I love to learn and challange
              myself, and this is why I think I’m perfect for this job.
